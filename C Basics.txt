  Focus on Core Concepts - Core of C, Core of Java, Core of Python.

  Java is the Case sensitive - focus on Pascal & Camel case.  - easy in Java

  Major Questions - Arrays + String + Logics related. 

  Data types in C + Header files C + functions in C + Looping & Conditions in C

 implementation - 

      input (lena kya hai) ->  Processing(based on Input & output ) <-   Output (dena kya hai)

   always work with free mind & step by steps. 


 how to work C - 

 1st - we need to include header files, stdio.h & conio.h but no for C compiler, that is default import in C compiler
       for file handling we need to include that. 

  #include<stdio.h> - include from lib folder - means include folder - include from lib location.
      or
  #include "stdio.h" - use for include the own header files, apni header file ko include karna hai to aap "" use karo
                       we can include .c & .txt file also - means include from user location

   Q- what is the diff b/w both statement? 

   header files?
    - contain the lib function/pre define functions/inbuild functions

      stdio - standard Input Output -.h - header file
      conio - console Input output - console means dos in windows or terminal window in Unix
              & Linux operating System. 

    Q- we can design own header files or not, if yes then what is the need of that. 
   Ans - yes can design, just save with .h extension or we can include .c or .txt file also. 

    need / use - use for implement the Modular Approach - 

      * Simplicity - easy to use
      * Reusability - design once & can/run any where
      * Performence Improve 
      * Error Handling & debugging easy 
      * Team work & Time Management.

  ** but no need for include for C compiler. 

 2nd - program always start with void main() function. 

 Q- how many type we have main function in C?

    in Java - main method -  public static void main(String args[]) {}

      public - access modifier
      static - keyword, for direct calling JVM without creating object of this class.
                 static data members can be call direct - with classnamme

      void - return type, void means no return any value. 
      main() - method, 1st method to be called by the JVM before calling any method, but after static block.
 
 -> program execution 
      in C - 1st preprocessor call honge then main call hoga - jo # ke saath use hai - 
              #include - for file input
              #define - for design the global var - use for array size / looping ke inside use karte ho
              #pragma - for call the function before & after main function. 

                  #pragma startup funName priority - 0 to 63 - C lib priority - we can use that, 64 to 255 user priority. 
                  #pragma exit funName priority          

      in Java - 1st static blocks call honge then main call hoga. 
  
  Q- what is default return type of function in C?
Ans- default return of function in C - int
  
    programming - 
      void main()  / int main() / main()  
    
      String - class , args[] - array of the String class that is used for command line arguments. 

   main in C - we have 2 Types main function - 

      void main() - without command line arguments.
      void main(int argc,char argv[]) - for command line argument - use with same argument name - argc & argv hi use karna hai

        
 3rd - all declaration before calling any function. 

 4th - for console output we can use printf() function or for console input we can use scanf() functions. 
   
        printf() - print with format., scanf() - scan with format. , Java - Scanner class - C ke inside scan

   * C ke inside jo use karna hai wo small letter me hi use karna hai excluding FILE type/pointer.

    Q- what is the return of printf() & scanf() function? 

  Ans- both function return type is int, printf() - return no of chars, -  x = printf("Welcome");  x = 7
 
       scanf() - return no of inputs - 1 input - return 1 , 2 - inputs - reurn 2, three input -return 3. 
  
    scanf() use - syn -  scanf("%d %d %d",&a,&b,&c);   - but no need to use & with string. - string means char arrays. 
  
     Q - we can pass msg inside scanf(), that is possible or not?
         ex -  scanf("Value of a is = %d",&a);

     now we want to store 1000 value in a , for that we need to input with same msg 

            input -  Value of a is 1000          now a = 1000 
                     (scanf msg ) (value of a)

   we can perform runtime input with - gets() / getch() / getche() also

     gets(name); - input value with space also. until enter key press. 
     getch() - get any char from keyboard but not display that. 
     getche() - get any char from keyword & display also. 
                   get - input , ch - char , e - echo - display 

  Major use of getch() - for hold the output screen. but getch() also use for design the encrypted based application
                         like - password program.
         getche() use for choice based application, Menu design - Confirmation - Do U want to same change - Y / N

  Looping - for loop + while + do while loop. 

    best loop - while loop - problem with for loop - more slow - bcos initialize every time/step. 
                problem with do while - one execution must, do loop - one time execute then check condition, if condition
                is true then execution contd.. else terminate. 
          Output based Question - always with while - 80% , 10-20% for 

      for(initialize;condition;incr/decr) {} 

 ** we can use any number of initialization & increment + decrement also - in any language - C, C++, Java, other language also
       for(i=1,j=10;i<=10;i++,j--) {} 
     ** but condition always 1 hi use karna hai... 

 in java we have one extra loop also that is for each loop - for loop enhance version - only use with arrays & collection classes. 
     syn - for(String n : ar) {}

  problem solving - Language - concat options - strcat() , sprintf() - return concated string.
      input 1234 , output in word - one thoudand hundred thirty four only. 

  conditions - if - else if - else , switch - case.
 
    problem with switch case kya hai - agar break use nahi kiya to saare statement ko call karega. 

  data types in C - primitive data types, int, char, long, float, double, + combination type also supported.
                     long int / long double.

   size of char data type - 1 byte - fixed, this the major problem with C - it support only 256 char set. 
          but in java - size of char data type is 2 bytes - for 512 charset support. - national char set also. 

   size of int data type - may be 2 bytes / 4 bytes - depends on compiler.  32 bits compiler - size of int 2 bytes / 64 bit compiler - size of int 2 bytes

    printf("format",var); 

     %d - for decimal values
     %u - unsigned Long - Pointer - address print purpose - %u
     %%ld - for long decimal values
     %c - for char input 
     %f - for float value
     %s - for String value.
